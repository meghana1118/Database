SELECT Score, (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Score) FROM Scores 
              WHERE Score>= s.Score) as rank
              FROM Scores s
              ORDER BY Score DESC
              
 #2nd Solution
SELECT s.Score, COUNT(DISTINCT t.score) Rank
FROM Scores s JOIN Scores t ON s.Score <= t.score
GROUP BY s.Id
ORDER BY s.Score desc
