QUESTION:
Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+


SOLUTION:
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE M INT;
    SET M = N-1;
    RETURN (
        SELECT DISTINCT(Salary) FROM Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET M
    );
    END
    
    
EXPLAINATION:
N is input to getNthHighestSalary function.
Write the Function using CREATE FUNCTION <Name> RETURN BEGIN RETURN END
OFFSET for previous exercise was 1, ie we wanted to start from 2nd entry so (2-1), thus for nth salary we need n-1
declare a new variable m which is equal to m
Don't forget ; after Declare,Return and Set
