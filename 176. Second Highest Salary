QUESTION:
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+


SOLUTION:
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
    
    
EXPLAINATION:
Salary might be repeated so use DISTINCT
Order by descending order, so for 2nd highest you can start counting from 2nd entry by setting offset to 1 and limiting output by 1.
IFNULL can be used if there is no second highest Salary(i.e. if there is only one entry in the table) and a Null value is shown as output.
